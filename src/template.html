                The food is fire, the vibes are questionable, and the 
                convenience store cat definitely doesn’t belong to us. 
                Inspired by the chaotic charm of your neighborhood's 
                most suspect corner store, Badega serves up 
                late-night eats, unapologetic flavors, and a heavy dose 
                of nostalgia. Whether you're here for a greasy-yet-glorious 
                chopped cheese, a bodega-style breakfast sandwich, or just a 
                tallboy and some attitude, we’ve got you covered. No frills, 
                no fuss—just damn good food in a place that feels like home 
                (if home had flickering neon lights and a broken ATM)
